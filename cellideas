LifeEngine cells:

    Mouth - Orange, eats food in directly adjacent cells.
    Producer - Green, randomly generates food in directly adjacent empty cells.
    Mover - Light blue, allows the organism to move and rotate randomly.
    Killer - Red, harms organisms in directly adjacent cells (besides itself).
    Armor - Purple, negates the effects of killer cells.
    Eye - Light purple with a slit, allows the organism to see and move intelligently. See further description below.


LifeEngineLite cells:
organisms require energy to perform actions
organisms take damage when no energy?
organism health = cell count? same as original?

food:
 - food like LifeEngine
 - Dense Food dropped by death of cells? worth more than normal food (5x?)


Mouth - Orange, eats food in directly adjacent cells.
	- no energy cost
	- 20 energy gained from eating food
	- 100 energy gained from eating dense food
//Producer - Yellow, randomly generates food in directly adjacent empty cells
//	- costs 20 energy to produce
//	- if no available cells, energy is preserved
Mover - Light blue, allows the organism to move and rotate randomly.
	- costs 1 energy to move 1 tile
Killer - Red, harms organisms in directly adjacent cells (besides itself).
	- costs 1 energy per tile harmed
Armor - Purple, negates the effects of killer cells.
	- no energy cost
Eye - Light purple with a slit, allows the organism to see and move intelligently. See further description below.
	- no energy cost? or maybe 1/tick?
Leaf - Dark Green, allows the organism to passively gain energy from the sun
	- +1 energy per tick
Blossom - Light Green, allows the organism to produce food in empty adjacent spots
	- costs 20 energy to produce fruit
